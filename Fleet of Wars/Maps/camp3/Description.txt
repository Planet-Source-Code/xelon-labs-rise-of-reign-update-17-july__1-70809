Sir,
	1400 hours back we got a report of ULPF establishment and research facility
Intel Also tells us that they found signs of unknown phenomena.
Later researches tell us that there is a crash site and ULPF research facility is located near.

	You have been elected as the commander-in-chief of the already established base
Your duty is to wipe out the research facility so that we can have real data about ETs.
							Good Luck, Sir
