OK, I am really impressed
	But now for the final assault
	
	The decoder successfully decoded the message.
	The message was some sort of signal from S-1129.

 According to the report from the Intel HQ
	The S-1129 is inhabited by the ETs and they are called
	UNPF by ULPF.
	UNPF (United Nova Planets Federation) is a federation of
	planets who lives near the Super Novas. They capture the 
	solar planets before the 10000 years before the death of 
	near star

 Map discovery team tells us,
	An unknown establishment of ULPF has been found in the 
	death spot.
	There our Intel has found a Planetary Destroyer. Which is 
	currently in static position.

	Our mission is to take out that Destroyer before it takes off
	You are equipped with advanced weapons and less time.

				Good luck,
				Whole world depends on you
