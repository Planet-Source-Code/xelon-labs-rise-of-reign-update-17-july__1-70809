History Begins after 2050,
Due to the dead political crisis and unclear thoughts of people on earth about existence of 
extraterrestrials. A migration took place. People denying the facts about ETs shifted themselves.

USPF: Main population settlement of humans on earth an surrounding planets
ULPF: Other minority group living in the planets far from Stars. They gather dark energy from the
nearby moons and prepare special weapons. They also got much info from past UFO crashes
They make unfair use of alien technology and also fear that once the existence of ET is 
confirmed they will have their weapons sale blocked.
