Sir,
	You proved to be most intelligent supreme commander of USPF.
You successfully decoded the power chain system. I still can't believe this.
OK, back to work.
	ULPF became short of power. This is some how a good news but 
also a bad news. This means that ULPF now uses the chain system every where.

The decoder was captured by ULPF and is currently in ULPF prison. You are 
given a scout vehicle and further reinforcements will arrive after you show something
to the HQ Chief.
						Best of Luck & 
						Bring him home
