Sir,
	Congratulations on your promotion.
		The tide is still in the water and we have to take it out
	Your skills really impressed the whole base committee.
The information gained from the crash site was pure and true but it found some sort 
of meaningless. It is some how encrypted and even our best experts are unable to decode
it. Only one man is capable of decrypting such data. We have sent some force to escort him
to main HQ.
	The problem is that a device called Disrupter is blocking our all radio transmissions
and air signals, further Intel tells us that it resists movement of all ships near it. The device gains
much power from land and launches a powerful beam of signals to S-1129 star cluster. This device
can be very dangerous for our planet. Take that device out and we will handle the nearby 
aircraft carrier which is main obstacle proved to our base. 
	Also, The units around it uses the chain power system. Means the power of units 
is shared by other units or structures. If any of them destroys the other also destroys.
							Good Luck
