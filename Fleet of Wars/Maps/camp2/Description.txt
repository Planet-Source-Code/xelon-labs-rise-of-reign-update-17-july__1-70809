Well done Sir,
	With your quick response and strategic moves we were successfully able to make the ULPF out of bounds
But the game isn't over yet, in response to our counter attack the ULPF has taken our desert base. 
Fight them head to head.
	And also, the information retrieved from the HQ was fake. We have to wait until next signal.

Use advanced and upgraded units
